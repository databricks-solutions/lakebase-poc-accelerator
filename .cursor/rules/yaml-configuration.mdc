# YAML Configuration Standards

## File Structure
- Use consistent indentation (2 spaces)
- Include comments for complex configurations
- Group related settings logically

## Workload Configuration
- Tables in `tables_to_sync` should have `name`, `primary_keys`, and `scheduling_policy`
- Use fully qualified table names (e.g., `samples.tpcds_sf1.customer`)
- Primary keys should be arrays even for single keys

## Databricks Bundle Configuration
- Use proper Databricks bundle syntax with `${}` for variable references
- Include proper resource definitions for synced database tables
- Use consistent naming conventions for resources

## Validation
- Ensure all required fields are present
- Validate table names and primary key formats
- Check for proper YAML syntax
