# Documentation Guidelines

## When to Create Documentation
- **DO NOT create README files, documentation, or instruction files unless explicitly requested by the user**
- **DO NOT create setup guides or getting started documentation unless specifically asked**
- **Focus on code implementation and technical solutions when not explicitly asked for documentation**

## When Documentation IS Requested
- Only create README files when the user explicitly asks for them
- Only create setup instructions when specifically requested
- Only create getting started guides when prompted
- Focus on technical content rather than verbose explanations

## Response Style
- Be concise and technical
- Provide code solutions directly
- Ask clarifying questions when needed
- Don't assume documentation is needed

## Code Comments
- Include inline comments explaining complex logic
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Document function parameters and return values
- Explain business logic and technical decisions
